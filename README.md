# `MPS_Spatial_Helper` package

A collection of code designed to help ingestion, manipulation and visualisation of MPS spatial data

Due to issues with Geopandas and PIP, if you are running Windows, we recommend installing this first using Conda.

The sub-folders should be used as follows:

- `create`: For creating geographical objects for analysis and processing;
- `display`: For creating and displaying maps;
- `ingest`: For ingesting data from MPS sources;
